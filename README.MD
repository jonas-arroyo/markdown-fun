This is a paragraph. It does not require any special syntax.

Surround content with two astricts in order to make something **bold**

Surrond content with one underscore in order to make it _italicized_

Wrap the content that you want to attach a link to with [brackets](http://www.allpawsrescueok.org/) followed by the URL wrapped in parentheses

Make a code snippet by surrounding your code with three backticks and indicating the language at the begging:

```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

Make an unorganized list by using a hyphen before each item:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Make a numbered list by using a number followed by a period for each item. You can do "1. Content" for each item and it will display the numbered list properly:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
